# Amplify + Nuxt Auth Guard Middleware Example

Quick example project showing how middleware can be applied using Amplify within Nuxt.

Middleware is applied on /test page.

Nuxt must be in SPA mode as Amplify doesn't currently support SSR. You can check SSR support status via this ticket:

## Build Setup

$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build

```
